# InteractiveDictionary

Uses the data.json file to give the user the definition of a given word.
The json file has almost every word and their definitions. Some words have multiple definitions and it returns them all.
The dictionary is interactive in the sense that if the user misspells a word, it will ask the user if they meant a word similar to it.
